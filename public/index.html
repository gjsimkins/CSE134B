                I am an aspiring Software Developer trying to figure out what exactly I want to do. Currently, I am
                studying Computer Science at UCSD. So far I have worked with Java, C++, React, and the basics of web
                development. When
                I'm not coding I enjoy playing video games, basketball, and watching Esports.

                be fun to
                include a little section about my favorite games of all time. </p>

                        <hr />
                        <p>Minecraft was one of the first games that I was really hooked on when I was little. Lead to
                            me to play a lot of other games. Don't play as much anymore but still my favorite game of
                            all time.</p>

                        <p>If Minecraft isn't my most played game, CSGO definitely is. CSGO hooked me into PC FPS games
                            and I have been playing ever since. Again, I might not play much anymore but CSGO has a
                            special place in my heart. </p>

                        <hr />
                        <p>I grew up mashing buttons playing Brawl and having no idea what was going on. The release of
                            Super Smash Bros. Ultimate brought me back and is one of my favorite games to play in my
                            spare time. However, since the online is so bad I rarely get a chance to play with my
                            friends. I also like to occasionally go to some tournaments for fun. </p>

                        <hr />
                        <p>Pokemon was one of my favorite games growing up. If your someone who knows me, you know for
                            some reason I chose to associate myself with everything squirtle. Anyways, Pokemon is a
                            classic to me and I still buy and play a Pokemon game here and there.</p>

                        <hr />
                        <p> Brawlhalla is probably the smallest game on this list. Its an indie platform fighter (Or
                            used to be indie as it got bought out by Ubisoft). It is the game that got my into platform
                            fighters and my second most played game on Steam.

                        <p>I know, I know, "Fortnite is for little kids." But for me, I had some of the most fun playing
                            Fortnite all day with my friends back during its peak. It was probably the golden age of
                            gaming for me, including CSGO, where me and friends would play all the time with no worries.

                        <p>I grew up playing Halo and still like playing it sometimes today. Another classic to me that
                            I stil enjoy and come back to.

                        <hr />
                        <p> Apex is one of my favorite games to play for the past year or so. I played on release a
                            little but got back into it a lot more a year or so ago. Its movement and abilites make it
                            one of my most fun FPS to play right now.

                        <p> Another game I grew up playing that I would still play today. More specifically I loved the
                            3D Mario's such as both Mario Galaxies and Mario 64.

                        <p> My last pick is somewhat a throw up. But as a kid I would confidently say Lego Star Wars:
                            The Complete Saga was my favorite game so I have to include it.
